## Introduction

The Euler-Mascheroni constant is defined as the limiting difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm. This project aims to make the constant easily accessible for developers working with JavaScript, Node.js, and other platforms that utilize floating-point arithmetic.

## Euler-Mascheroni Constant

The Euler-Mascheroni constant is defined as:

\[ \gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} - \ln(n) \right) \approx 0.5772156649 \]

This constant has a wide range of applications in mathematical analysis, statistics, and number theory.

### Mathematical Properties

- **Approximation**: The constant is approximately equal to 0.5772156649.
- **Applications**: It appears in integrals, series, and asymptotic expansions.
- **Relation to other constants**: The Euler-Mascheroni constant connects with other mathematical constants such as pi and the golden ratio.

## Usage

To utilize the Euler-Mascheroni constant in your project, simply import the module:

```javascript
const eulerGamma = require('constants-float32-eulergamma');

console.log(eulerGamma); // Output: 0.5772156649 (as a Float32)
```

This simple interface allows you to easily integrate the constant into your calculations.
